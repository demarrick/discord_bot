# discord-bot

This simple bot uses absolute paths related to my own system.
The principle is to have a bot able to stream audio files such as songs whenever someone joins the voice channel, audio file can be played also my typing a specific command in the general chat. 
Additional "on_message" functionalities have been added but have marginal importance.
